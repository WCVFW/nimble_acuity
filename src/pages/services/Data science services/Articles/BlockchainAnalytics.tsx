        <section className="space-y-4 text-gray-700">
          <p>
            A decade has passed since Satoshi Nakamoto propounded the concept of
            blockchain through a seminal paper titled{" "}
            <em>"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"</em>. And in
            these ten intervening years, blockchain has comfortably freed itself
            from being trapped inside cryptocurrency miners' lexicon to set foot
            in new areas: banking, retail, automobile, logistics, healthcare,
            crowdfunding, or voting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such is the excitement brewing around blockchain that venturesome
            companies are in a mad rush to explore the technology. A global IBM
            study found that one-third (33%) of enterprises across all sectors
            and regions are already considering or actively engaged with
            blockchains.

            Why Blockchain Analytics?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            The answer lies in the two intrinsic abilities of a blockchain
            network: immutability and unparalleled transparency. When a firm
            employs analytics, it has to rely on data to get desired insights.
            But what if the very data is unreliable or corrupt? Blockchain
            ensures verified data integrity, making analytics trustworthy.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Blockchain analytics brings end-users, data owners, developers, and
            analysts together to the same environment. The challenge lies in
            integrating on-chain and off-chain data while ensuring security,
            query federation, and optimization.
