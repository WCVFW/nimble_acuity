          <p>
            Customers today use multiple channels to search, purchase, and get
            information. Unfortunately, many companies still rely on outdated
            engagement methods, which can frustrate or disappoint customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            To provide exciting and convenient customer experiences, businesses
            must leverage artificial intelligence (AI). AI can create deeply
            personal customer journeys that feel natural and engaging like never
            before.

            The Need for AI in Customer Experience
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Customer experience can be a double-edged sword: done poorly, it
            leads to failure; done right, it delivers huge competitive
            advantages. Real-time, actionable insights are critical, but messy,
            unstructured datasets make this hard. This is where AI shines.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            AI helps businesses identify patterns, understand preferences, and
            deliver consistent experiences across every touchpoint.

            Adopting AI in Businesses
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Industry experts predict enterprise investment in AI will grow by
            over 300% in the coming year. But AI affects three main groups:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
            <li>The developers and teams implementing the AI systems</li>
            <li>Employees whose tasks may be partially automated</li>
            <li>The customers who directly interact with AI-driven services</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mt-3">
            Younger generations may adopt AI naturally, while older employees
            and customers may face a steeper learning curve. Regulations like
            GDPR also shape how businesses collect and use customer data.

            Collaborating with AI
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Human-machine collaboration can produce great outcomes. Natural
            language processing and machine learning allow organizations to
            analyze conversations, detect complaints, and improve customer
            experiences over time.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Employees will need new skills to work effectively with intelligent
            systems, but human expertise in business and customer domains will
            always be essential.
