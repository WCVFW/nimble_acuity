          Does your present product recall procedure lack defined workflows and
          is it not in line with compliance-critical (Critical-to-Quality) CTQs?
          If yes, then you need product recall management and support services.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          <strong>Nimble Auity</strong> is one of the leading providers of
          product recall management services in India. We understand that
          product recalls can be devastating for a brand and can plummet its
          reputation if the recall ecosystem is not robust. At Nimble, we use
          (Voice of Customer) VoC-to-CTQ mapping technique, based on
          international risk governance standards, to determine recall
          priorities. With more than 27 years of operational experience, we have
          verified our recall response frameworks. We leverage product recall
          management best practices to help you streamline your recall process.
