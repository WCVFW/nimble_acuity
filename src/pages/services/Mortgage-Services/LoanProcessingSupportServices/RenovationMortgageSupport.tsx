              Our Renovation Loan Mortgage Support Services
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Our comprehensive services are designed to simplify the renovation loan process for you:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-4 text-gray-700">
              <li>
                <strong>Loan Processing:</strong> We leave no stone unturned when screening and pre-qualifying borrowers. We verify everything from credit reports and pay stubs to employment proof and loan applications. We also check contractor licenses, work permits, and insurance to ensure eligibility for loans like FHA 203k and Homestyle loans.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Property Inspection and Scope of Work (SOW):</strong> We help lenders examine the property to understand the full scope of work and identify all impending repairs. Our analysis compares reported information with inspection findings to determine potential risks and ensure the loan amount doesn't exceed the value warranted for the renovation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Property Appraisal:</strong> Our appraisal process considers the after-repair value (ARV) to accurately establish the extent of renovation work required and the loan amount needed. Once the appraisal is complete, we compile a comprehensive report of all jobs to be carried out.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Loan Underwriting:</strong> We collaborate with underwriters and loan processors to avoid miscommunication and delays. We proactively verify documents to ensure that only error-free submissions reach the underwriter, accelerating the decision-making process.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Loan Closing:</strong> As part of our services, we compile a loan package with full repayment instructions, loan tenure, and disclaimers. We can also assist in creating an escrow account and providing timely support to borrowers regarding documentation needs throughout the renovation stage.
              </li>
            </ul>
