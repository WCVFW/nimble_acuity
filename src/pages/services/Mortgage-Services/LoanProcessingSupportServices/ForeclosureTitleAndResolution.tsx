              Before selling a foreclosed property, it's crucial to review the full chain of title. At **Nimble Acuity**, we have extensive experience in ensuring this for our clients. Our foreclosure title resolution service is designed to provide comprehensive support to lenders and credit unions. By outsourcing to us, we conduct extensive research of public records and match it with the current title. This is vital to find current liens and identify any conflicts with the title.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              To resolve issues completely, we investigate all relevant parties in the foreclosure action. This ensures the foreclosed property has a **marketable title**—one that cannot be contested in the future.

              Why Check and Resolve Title Issues Before Foreclosure?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Sometimes a foreclosed property may have multiple owners or pending taxes, which can lead to major title issues. It’s essential that all owners sign the closing documents at the time of foreclosure and that all delinquent taxes and outstanding judgments are settled before a clear title is received.
