            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-4 text-gray-700">
              <li>
                <strong>Pre-qualification of Borrower:</strong> We review Form 1003 and screen all documents to ensure accuracy. By carefully reviewing each portfolio before submission, we eliminate risks during the loan approval stage.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Loan Processing Support:</strong> We thoroughly check employment history, financial health reports, and credit history to evaluate a borrower's eligibility. We verify authorization documents, pay stubs, and W-2 forms and save verified information in a CRM system.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Loan Underwriting:</strong> Our experienced underwriters audit all reported data, verifying credit reports, income statements, and borrower information to ensure there is no mismatch between reported and appraisal values before approving the loan.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Mortgage Appraisal Support:</strong> We offer mortgage appraisal support to help you verify if the reported description of the collateral is accurate. We conduct drive-by and comprehensive appraisals and furnish a final report to speed up loan processing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Mortgage Post-closing Services:</strong> After loan approval, we provide complete support to close the mortgage. We handle auditing the loan package, clearing the title, recording procedures, and maintaining an organized workflow to ensure compliance with mortgage laws.
