              To provide a superior service experience and ensure financial security, a mortgage title support company must have a 360-degree view of a property's transaction history. When you partner with us for mortgage title support services, we delve deep into property records to prevent significant delinquencies. Our services are designed to cut down turnaround time and speed up decision-making, including:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-4 text-gray-700">
              <li>
                <strong>Ordering Mortgage Title:</strong> We order mortgage titles on the lender's behalf to ensure the collateral has a clear mortgage lien, a crucial step for preventing legal disputes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Title Search:</strong> We conduct thorough title searches at the city, county, and even area-specific levels. Our expert loan officers collaborate with title companies to retrieve highly-accurate title reports and routinely follow up with all relevant stakeholders.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Title Assessment:</strong> We scan property titles for unresolved disputes and irregularities. Our service acts as a fraud deterrent, alerting lenders if a property has legal complications or does not qualify as ideal collateral. We look for past lawsuits, liens, defaulted taxes, and other legal claims.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Title Commitment:</strong> This is a final summary of the title search and ordering process. It includes the title insurance conditions and resolves any faults or peculiarities found during the title assessment. The commitment report facilitates a smooth mortgage closure.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Mortgage Title Insurance:</strong> If you need help with title insurance for your clients, we've got you covered.
