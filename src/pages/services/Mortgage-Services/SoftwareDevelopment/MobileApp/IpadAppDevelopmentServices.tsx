              The iPad's increasing popularity as a media consumption and productivity device has created a massive market for tablet-specific apps. Unlike the iPhone, the iPad's larger screen and features like multitasking, gaming enhancements, and Apple Pencil support require a distinct development approach to provide a truly exceptional user experience.

              At Nimble Acuity, our team of professional iOS designers and coders is committed to developing bespoke apps for both the iPad and iPad Pro. We believe that a one-size-fits-all approach for both iPhone and iPad apps can alienate your audience, which is why we focus on creating unique apps that take full advantage of the iPad's specific features.
