              What is VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure)?
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) is a technology that describes how desktop virtualization can benefit applications such as remote, branch, and telecommuters. VDI allows businesses to maximize resources by centralizing software and hardware to support all end-users.

              What is VDI Used For?
            </h4>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700">
              <li>
                <strong>Remote Work:</strong> A growing number of organizations are using VDI to manage and update the virtual desktops of their remote employees.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Shift or Task Work:</strong> Nonpersistent VDI is particularly appealing to organizations such as call centers where a large number of employees perform highly standardized tasks using the same software.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bring Your Own Device (BYOD):</strong> VDI is an ideal solution for environments that allow or require employees to use their own devices. It offers better security because data stays safely on the server and is no longer stored on the end user's device.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4 className="text-xl font-medium text-[#006A7C] mt-6 mb-2">
              What is the Difference Between VDI and Desktop Virtualization?
            </h4>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Desktop virtualization is a general term used to describe any technology that separates a desktop environment from the hardware used to access it. VDI is one specific implementation of desktop virtualization, where users connect to a shared desktop running on a remote server.
