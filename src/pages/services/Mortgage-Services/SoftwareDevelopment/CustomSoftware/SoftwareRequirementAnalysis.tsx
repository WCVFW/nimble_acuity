                <strong>Unified Modeling Language (UML):</strong>
                <p className="mt-2">We create integrated diagrams for the specification, visualization, construction, and documentation of software artifacts. We also use UML for the validation of software architecture.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Data Flow Diagram (DFD):</strong>
                <p className="mt-2">DFDs are a proven way to show how information flows through a process. We use standardized notations to describe the relationships between entities.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Flowchart Technique:</strong>
                <p className="mt-2">For related activities in a software project, we use flowcharts to represent the control logic and sequential flow. We flexibly use various formats, including top-down, cross-functional, and linear, to depict data flows and system interactions.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Role Activity Diagrams:</strong>
                <p className="mt-2">This technique captures and represents the role structure within a software process, providing an overview of the activities in a system.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>GAP Analysis:</strong>
                <p className="mt-2">We use GAP analysis to discover performance gaps in a software application, helping us determine if development teams can meet your business objectives.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Gantt Charts:</strong>
                <p className="mt-2">We use Gantt charts to visually represent task schedules and completion dates for your project.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN):</strong>
                <p className="mt-2">As a methodology to improve processes, BPMN is used for requirement analysis using a set of standard symbols. This is similar to creating flowcharts where graphs are built using business process modeling notations.</p>
