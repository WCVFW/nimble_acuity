                            In-house Angular development often involves significant upfront costs for talent acquisition, infrastructure management, and development tools.

Most Angular projects require diverse skill sets across TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Angular CLI, RxJS, and testing tools like Karma and Jasmine, as well as proficiency in framework features, performance optimization, and cross-browser compatibility.
