                            Some businesses classify their app portfolio as tiers while others prefer nomenclatures like legacy and current.

If you're among those businesses that can't have a reach in all areas of app management, outsource application portfolio management services to Nimble Acuity. In doing so, our infrastructure becomes accessible for application portfolio analysis while you have the freedom to focus on many other things.
