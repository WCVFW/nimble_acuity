              Appraisal underwriting helps lenders and credit unions get a correct estimate of the home on sale. As lenders cannot afford to overlook over-inflated property values, they rely heavily on appraisal underwriting to avoid the mistake of over-lending. This helps them stay in compliance with regulatory requirements mandated by US housing bodies.
