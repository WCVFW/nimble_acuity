                <strong>Mortgage Prefunding Quality Control:</strong> We assess loans for errors or anomalies before they are closed. We verify all information, forms, documents, and other components of the loan portfolio to ensure data accuracy and availability.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Mortgage Post-Funding Quality Control:</strong> We assess data integrity and verify the accuracy and availability of supporting documents after funding. We also cross-verify the completed loan application to ensure it matches the allotted loan amount and that the "4 Cs" (credit, capacity, collateral, and capital) are correctly represented.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Mortgage Underwriting Quality Control:</strong> We perform a thorough quality check of underwriting decisions before a loan is cleared for funding. We ensure data integrity and make sure the underwriting report is comprehensively checked so you only fund loans with a high probability of repayment.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Fraud Checks:</strong> Our team has vast experience detecting anomalies and discrepancies. We meticulously check for conflicting personal information, unusual account transactions, and missing information to identify errors, omissions, or premeditated rule-flouting.
