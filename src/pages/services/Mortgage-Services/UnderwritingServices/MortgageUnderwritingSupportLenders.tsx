              What Underwriting Support Entails
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Underwriting is the process a lender uses to determine if the risk of providing a mortgage loan is within acceptable limits. This leads to the final decision of whether or not to approve the loan. Although automation is now part of the process, underwriters are still required to meticulously investigate the applicant and determine their repayment capacity by following "the three C's of underwriting."
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-4 text-gray-700">
              <li>
                <strong>Credit History:</strong> We check how well the loan applicant has been paying off debts by looking for foreclosures or bankruptcy.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Capacity:</strong> We evaluate the applicant's ability to repay the loan by analyzing their debt-to-income ratio, salary, and cash reserves.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Collateral:</strong> We assess the borrower's down payment, loan-to-value ratio, property type, and use. This is a crucial step, as you, the lender, will be left with the home if the borrower fails to make timely payments.
