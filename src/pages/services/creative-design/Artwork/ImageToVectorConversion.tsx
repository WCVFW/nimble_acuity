        <p>
          Although resolution-dependent images were used more often in the past, today, such images have lost their importance and are being rarely used now. Businesses today prefer vector images as vectorized images are resolution independent and hence provide better clarity and are not pixelated when expanded. This makes vector images one of the most preferred formats by companies across different industry sectors.
