          A mascot is an integral part of any company's branding strategy and its scope is not limited to a design or
          illustration. Mascots are like virtual brand ambassadors, depicting the brand values and identity. Creating
          mascot characters demands a creative and expert team of visualizers, designers, and marketers. <strong>Nimble
          Auity (Nimble)</strong> is one of the most renowned companies in the world with an exceptionally skilled
          creative team for mascot designing. We have created more than 500 mascots for clients in 50+ countries,
          helping many of our customers to win accolades and awards for innovative and creative branding ideas.
        </p>

        <p>
          A mascot, however, should not be confused with character design or even a mascot logo as they differ from one
          another. Character design is more of a concept-art dealing with designing personas for the brand in the form of
          characters. They are commonly used for various marketing and advertising purposes. Mascot design is the
          creation of one distinguishing character that reflects the brand qualities through its demeanor, colors, poses,
          and everything else. A mascot logo design is its extension where the mascot is also incorporated in the brand
          logo for improved brand identification.
