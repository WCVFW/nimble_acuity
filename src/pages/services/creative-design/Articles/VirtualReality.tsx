        <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">What is Virtual Reality?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Virtual Reality (VR) describes a computer-generated 3D environment with which a person can interact. VR experiences allow manipulation of surrounding objects and, in some systems, simulate sensory inputs like sound and smell for a fully immersive experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          VR promises an augmented experience of the world, impacts gaming, healthcare, education, fashion, and aims to usher in a new era of innovation.
