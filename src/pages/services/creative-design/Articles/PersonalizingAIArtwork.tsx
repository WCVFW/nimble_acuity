        <div>
          <p>
            With design being a significant part of the digital age, personalization and localization have become crucial. Artificial Intelligence enables designers to create artwork that reflects user preferences and diverse cultural contexts using technologies like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

        <div>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">The Transition of Design in Contemporary Society</h2>
          <p>
            Technology has transformed design from basic computer-aided methods to faster, creative, and highly interactive designs. The global creative design market is projected to reach $249 billion by 2025, fueled by advanced applications allowing vector graphics, 3D graphics, and enhanced user engagement.
