                                    We start by gaining an understanding of the issue or the problem that requires the change. We work to gain an in-depth understanding of how complex the project would be by assessing the degree of change required with the help of a high-level assessment.

                                    After studying the scope of the project, we raise an engineering change request (ECR) and delve deeper into the details of the proposal. The proposal includes all the information that is later passed to the stakeholders to help them decide whether or not to proceed with the requested changes.
                                </p>

                                    After creating an ECR after thoroughly assessing the feasibility of the change, we pass this proposed ECR through a review and approval stage. We send this ECR to the committee that then assesses the ECR and decides whether or not to approve the request.
                                </p>

                                    After the approval of the engineering change request, we move on to create the engineering change order (ECO). Based on the ECR, the ECO is created, and when completely in place, it serves as a blueprint for the implementation of the changes.
                                </p>

                                    We also pass the ECO through a round of approval, this time by involving different experts and stakeholders.

                                    When the ECO is approved, we communicate the engineering change notice (ECN) to different stakeholders. The ECN lists out the changes that have to be implemented.

                                    Once all the relevant groups are notified about the ECN, we implement the changes. Every team is delegated the respective responsibility as per their role in the change implementation.
