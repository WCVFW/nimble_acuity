                               Businesses that invest regularly in R&D report up to an 11.8% annual growth. On the other hand, hiring in-house engineers and investing in technology, resources, and infrastructure ultimately chip away at profit margins. Hence, the key to optimizing production lies in outsourcing mechanical engineering services to a reliable service provider.
