              Clinical research is the heart of every drug discovery, helping pharmaceutical companies assess the efficiency and safety of new drugs. However, seeking approval is a lengthy and complicated process that requires professional expertise. For approval, companies must submit multiple regulatory documents while meeting current good clinical practice regulations, a process that consumes a lot of time.
