              To accurately locate, access, and retrieve medical data, digitizing clinical information has become the need of the hour. But the medical sector, including hospitals, clinics, physicians, doctors, and medical billing companies, generates a substantial amount of data. This makes the task of storing data in an electronic format a time-consuming and laborious job. When medical data, including patient & treatment details, chart information, insurance plans, claims & billing data, diagnosis information, and settlement records, is presented in an electronic format, it helps streamline administrative operations, ultimately allowing for better patient care.
