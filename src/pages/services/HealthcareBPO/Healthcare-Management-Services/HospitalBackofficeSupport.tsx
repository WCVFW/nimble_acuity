              When you process medical claims in-house, you spend a large chunk of cash on medical billing & coding, revenue cycle management, and debt follow-upâ€”all of which are not your core work.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
              In a hospital, back-office support activities are confined to non-medical areas, including billing, counseling, payment & follow-up, and insurance verification. Managing all of these in-house requires extreme caution. When you outsource to **Nimble Acuity**, we exercise unparalleled importance to all administrative processes and have established a time-tested approach to render exceptional services.
