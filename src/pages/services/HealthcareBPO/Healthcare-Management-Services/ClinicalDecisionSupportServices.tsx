              The most important essence in integrated morbidity care is fast decision-making and shared care management that is well-coordinated by caregivers and patients. This is easier on paper but tough to achieve without sound clinical decision support services (CDS). Multimorbidity affects patient medication, overlapping guidelines, and the evidencing process in healthcare.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              The best way to streamline the process is to outsource clinical decision support services to <strong>nimble acuity</strong> so experts can take over clinical decision support roles to provide backend support to face challenges such as alerting conflicting guidelines and reconciliation of the correct care plan. We implement CDS digitally so that caregivers can ensure compliance at all times and practice the correct guidelines to keep up-to-date with evolving clinical rules. The biggest benefit is the ability to collaboratively manage personal care programs.
