          Market Basket Analysis in data mining is a key technique that helps
          retailers uncover dealings between consumers and items. It looks into
          a combination of items that figure regularly in transactions of a
          consumer. The technique is based on the theory that if a person buys
          or does not buy certain items, they are more or less likely to buy a
          second group of items.
