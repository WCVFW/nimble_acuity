        <p>
          The Indian way of education which lays great emphasis on higher education and
          specialization, creates a readily available talent pool with specialized knowledge
          in any field. There is also tremendous emphasis on mathematics and science,
          resulting in a large number of science and engineering graduates.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">The Science and Technology Edge</h2>
        <p className="mb-3">
          The Government of India set up IITs (Indian Institute of Technology) and IIMs
          (Indian Institute of Management) across the country in the 50s & 60s. These ivy-league
          institutes of formal education are centers of excellence competing with the best
          institutes worldwide.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          Another milestone was the establishment of IIIT (Indian Institute of Information
          Technology) as a joint initiative by the government and industry. Apart from
          producing B.Tech/M.Tech/PhD graduates, it also trains professionals and
          industry-sponsored candidates.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-3">
          India has more than 250 universities (over 900 colleges) and engineering colleges
          providing computer education at the degree/diploma level. The output of trained
          human power at the degree/diploma level has been consistently increasing since 1985
          and touched 130,000 during the year 2000. The formal education system is augmented by
          thousands of private training institutes providing computer education. By mid-2002,
          India had 840 business schools, which turned out 65,000 MBAs.
        </p>
        <p>
          With India’s infotech sector firmly in a leadership position on the global map, its
          scientific and research talent has also been acknowledged by the world. India is an
          emerging hub for contract research and clinical trials. India’s biotech sector spans
          the spectrum of BioPharma, BioAgri, BioIndustrial, Bioinformatics, and Bioservices
          industries.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">The English Advantage</h2>
        <p>
          In all good educational institutions, from kindergarten to graduation and beyond,
          the preferred medium of education is English, resulting in a significantly large
          population of educated and qualified professionals with English language skills.
          Many of them think in English, write in English and speak English as if it were their
          mother tongue.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Government Policies that Aid Outsourcing</h2>
        <p className="mb-3">
          The Indian government has recognized that knowledge processes will influence
          economic development extensively in the future and has taken remarkable measures
          towards liberalization and deregulation. Recent reforms have reduced licensing
          requirements, made foreign technology accessible, removed restrictions on investment
          and made the process of investment much easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          The government has been continuously improving infrastructure with better roads,
          setting up technology parks, opening up the telecom sector for enhanced connectivity,
          providing uninterrupted power to augment growth.

      {/* Trust Factor */}
      <section className="mb-12">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">India - The Trust Factor</h2>
        <p className="mb-3">
          Proactive measures are being taken to ensure that India is viewed as a destination
          for trustworthy outsourcing. Initiatives from individual companies to associations
          like NASSCOM and the Indian government are working together to build trust in Brand
          India as the world’s leading outsourcing center and a growing Research Services hub.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indian companies are taking serious measures to protect the information of their
          customers. Common security procedures in companies ensure that employees swipe
          identity cards, have their bags and pockets searched, deposit devices in lockers, and
          shred notes of client conversations after the shift ends.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Sustaining the Momentum</h2>
        <p>
          The Indian government has been taking the right steps to ensure an ever-increasing
          talent pool of highly qualified professionals. IITs / IIITs have been planned in every
          state. The industry would help formulate some of the courses offered to ensure that
          emerging professionals are in sync with industry requirements.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Quality Initiatives & Standards</h2>
        <p>
          HRD divisions in most companies have well-defined processes to hire the right
          professionals. They allocate substantial energies towards regular training and
          constantly develop ways to address attrition. More than 200 companies are
          quality-accredited and serve over 255 Fortune 500 companies. India now has far more
          SEI CMM Level 5 companies than any other country.

        <p>
          With business opportunities in India as attractive as those overseas, many highly
          qualified Indians are opting to return to India. An Indian who has returned after
          international exposure demonstrates the best blend of western work system experience
          and familiarity with Indian work ethics.
