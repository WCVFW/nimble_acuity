          Businesses make key decisions with <strong>business research services</strong> 
          and <strong>business intelligence (BI)</strong>. Business research services 
          collect information, process it, and generate reports on market, consumer, 
          and business insights. BI tools help analyze data through reports, 
          illustrations, and data mining, converting it into actionable insights.

          According to <strong>Celonis</strong>, the global BI market is valued at{" "}
          <strong>$29.42 billion in 2023</strong> and is projected to grow to{" "}
          <strong>$63.76 billion by 2032</strong>. Their importance in decision-making 
          cannot be undermined as they provide an evidence-based approach that boosts 
          efficiency, initiates innovation, and maintains competitive advantage.
