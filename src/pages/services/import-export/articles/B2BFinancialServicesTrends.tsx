          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Financial institutions are using customer data to tailor experiences and
            precisely address client needs. Advanced analytics help segment audiences
            based on preferences, past interactions, and behaviors, leading to more
            relevant communication. Customized content, targeted ads, and personalized
            emails are common examples.

          </h3>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Today’s B2B financial firms must integrate multiple ways of customer
            interaction, ensuring a consistent experience across websites, social
            media, mobile, and physical branches. Cross-channel marketing helps decode

          <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            For example, a customer who starts a loan application on mobile can
