          Benchmarking has become a vital performance metric in the healthcare industry. It allows
          organizations to level up with the industry standards of healthcare practices, thereby
          improving the quality of service. According to a poll by MGMA, 84% of healthcare leaders
          have increased their operations using benchmarking.

          Nowadays, in the dynamic environment, where technological innovations transform healthcare
          rapidly, small organizations may fail to catch up to the latest upgradation. Moreover, you
          may also falter at strategic decision making due to insufficient data. With performance
          benchmarking you can identify the gaps and collect necessary data to take the quality of
          your patient care to the next level. Let's check how it can be beneficial for your
          healthcare center.

          Benchmarking involves evaluating the organization's performance with industry standards
          for increasing operational efficiency and patient satisfaction. Let’s check the most

            <p>
              This process refers to comparing performance metrics within other departments of the
              same hospital. Reviewing the process internally reveals the discrepancies that might
              happen internally. For example, if you compare the patient satisfaction score of
              emergency units with the surgical ones, you can evaluate your internal processes and
              practices.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">External Benchmarking in Healthcare</h3>
            <p>
              When a healthcare center decides to evaluate the performance with the industry
              standards and their existing peers, they may opt to conduct external benchmarking. For
              instance, you can compare the readmission rates or the infection rates of your
              organizations with other hospitals at the state or national level.

          A benchmark study involves systematically comparing an organization's performance metrics
          against industry standards or best practices to identify areas of improvement. It aims to
          uncover performance gaps and opportunities for adopting effective strategies.
