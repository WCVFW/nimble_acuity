                            ASP.NET MVC is a standard design pattern that can significantly boost a web application. By using the ASP.NET MVC framework, you can easily manage your entire application by dividing it into the model, the view, and the controller (MVC). This provides end-to-end control, as there is no view state or server-based forms. Besides, .NET MVC provides better support for test-driven development (TDD).
                        </p>
