              Whether you are a vendor providing a networking solution or an end-user, you need to know that your network can handle traffic correctly at all times. Information flows are now massive for most organizations. Corporations reorganize, data centers move to the cloud, and businesses expand nationally and internationally, all of which mean increases in communication. Quality network testing solutions are therefore extremely critical.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Network testing is performed to ensure that the network configuration works as expected. While similar to software testing, a key difference is that network testing frequently needs to happen in the production environment after configuration changes have been made.

                  If you install a new WAN link or remote site, we can verify whether you get the bandwidth requested of your carrier using tools like iPerf. We also perform ping operations to confirm that your circuit doesnâ€™t suffer from any packet loss.

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Due to network complexity, larger networks have a higher risk that routing policy changes can have unexpected consequences. We use distributed monitoring agents to perform continuous traceroute and ping tests to validate in real-time whether your routing policy changes are modifying your routing table as designed.

                  We understand the importance of confirming that new firewall rulesets are successfully implemented. To verify that firewalls have been updated successfully, we use port scanners like nmap or perform ping tests from unprotected to protected networks.
