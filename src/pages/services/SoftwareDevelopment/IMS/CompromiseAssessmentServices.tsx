                            If your network has already been breached, Nimble Acuity can detect attacks designed to evade your existing defenses. We then inform you about the nature of the threat and its escalation. Nimble Acuity assumes your network has already been compromised and that an advanced persistent threat has obtained full access to one or more of your company systems. As a leading compromise assessment company, Nimble Acuity uses forensic-state analysis to methodically examine endpoints to see whether your company has been breached.
