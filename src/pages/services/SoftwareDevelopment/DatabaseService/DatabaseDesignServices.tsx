We clearly understand each client's needs and the data they leverage, which helps us design a suitable database structure. So, what is important when designing a database?

                            <li>How does the DBMS support indexing, constraints, referential integrity, and data types?</li>
                            <li>What are the features of the latest version of the database?</li>
                            <li>What are the DBMS configuration parameters?</li>
