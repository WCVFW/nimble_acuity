                                <p>
                                    Apache Ignite's durable memory offers double benefits—while it helps utilize the RAM as a caching layer, it also offers the functionality of deploying the RAM as a fully-functional storage layer. The in-memory data store offers great speed and scalability in terms of unlimited writes and reads.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <p>
                                    Ignite native persistence integrates with Ignite's strong memory transparently and seamlessly. It is a distributed disk store that is also strongly consistent. Distributed storage offers the benefits of centralized storage more cost-effectively with the scalability of local storage.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <p>
                                    The data stored, both on the disk and in the memory of Apache Ignite, is ACID-compliant, which means it consists of the four components that result in the completion of the database transaction promptly. These four components are—atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability. This functionality can be of great benefit to your business.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <p>
                                    Structured Query Language is a language that lets the database servers store as well as edit the data on them. It aids in performing various tasks like updating the data on a database and retrieving the data from a database. It allows the execution of a host of fast data manipulation. The best thing about SQL support that Apache Ignite offers is that there is no need for writing any codes.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <p>
                                    This feature of Apache Ignite allows moving the data based on data affinity declaration as the data is distributed to nodes. With this, we can lower the data transmission that happens over the network, thus improving performance and scalability.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                <p>
                                    Linear horizontal scaling offers great elasticity in adding more to your already existing pool of resources. This also means that we can add, remove, or even upgrade nodes to a running cluster in a speedy manner. This is also one of the useful features of Apache Ignite that go into our services.
