              **Odoo** is the acronym for an intuitive dashboard called “on-demand open object.” The dashboard stores a range of business applications and modules for sales management, HRMS, CRM, e-commerce, and more. While implementing Odoo can be a big advantage, it can also be a daunting proposition. However, partnering with the right Odoo partner can make the going a lot easier.
