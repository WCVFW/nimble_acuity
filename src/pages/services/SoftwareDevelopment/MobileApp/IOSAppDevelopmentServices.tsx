                            The smartphone revolution began with the iPhone, and today Apple still enjoys a dominant market share in key regions. With the help of both the iPhone and iPad, the iOS ecosystem allows thousands of developers around the world to reap the benefits of its superior app marketplace.

Therefore, if you are looking to outsource iOS application development, you cannot leave the work to novice developers.
