        Most professional photographers trust their clicks with nothing else
        than RAW format. Considered equal to the classic photographic negatives,
        RAW gives photographers the widest possible flexibility, as it is the
        digital equivalent of a negative film that retains all the details of an
        actual image as captured by the camera's sensor. The RAW format captures
        details better than any other formats and preserves the entire spectrum
        of colors in a particular click.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">RAW Conversion - Processing</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        One major differentiating factor in RAW format is that it is not
        processed by the camera and remains undeveloped until converted into a
        JPEG or TIFF file. All the benefits that you can avail from a RAW file
        lies in between the click and the conversion to JPEG â€“ in the RAW
        conversion processes such as demosaicing, white balancing, and
        sharpening.
